# Day-ahead electricity market coupling in CWE region
This repository contains the code for the model of market coupling. The model is limited to the day-ahead electricity market in CWE region. There are two versions of the main code; ATC market coupling, flow based market coupling. These two market coupling schemes are the focus of this research

# Test Example:

A small example where both the ATC and FBMC is implemented. The zip file contains the code for the model and also some results. The pdf "Test Example Details" goes over the basics of the example and also two market coupling schemes.

# Remarks:

All the details regarding the code can be found in the text file 'Info'.
